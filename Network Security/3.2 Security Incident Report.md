# Security Incident Report: OS Hardening

## Part 1 : Identify the Network Protocol Involved in the Incident

The network protocol involved in this incident is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which operates at the application layer of the TCP/IP model. Since the incident revolves around accessing the web server for **yummyrecipesforme.com**, HTTP traffic was identified as the protocol facilitating communication between the client browser and the web server.

The **tcpdump** logs confirm the usage of HTTP during the interaction with the website. Furthermore, the malicious file prompting the users to download new recipes was transported using the HTTP protocol, showcasing its role in the attack. This highlights how attackers exploited HTTP communication to deliver malicious content.

## Part 2 : Document the Incident

Several customers reported to the helpdesk that upon visiting the website **yummyrecipesforme.com**, they were prompted to download a file offering access to new recipes. After running the file, their computers began to operate unusually slowly. Additionally, the website owner reported being locked out of their administrative account.

To investigate, the cybersecurity team replicated the issue in a sandbox environment to avoid impacting the company network. Using **tcpdump**, the analyst captured network traffic while interacting with the website. During the analysis, the browser initially made an HTTP request to resolve the IP address for **yummyrecipesforme.com**. Upon establishing a connection, the analyst downloaded and executed the file, as prompted by the website. Shortly afterward, the browser redirected to a different URL, **greatrecipesforme.com**, using HTTP traffic. This URL resolved to a new IP address, confirming that the network traffic had been rerouted to a malicious website.

Further analysis revealed that the attacker had manipulated the website's source code to inject functionality prompting users to download a malicious file disguised as a browser update. The investigation also uncovered that the attacker likely gained access to the web serverâ€™s administrative account through a brute force attack, which enabled them to modify the website content. Execution of the downloaded file compromised end users' systems, leading to the reported issues.

 ## Part 3: Recommend One or More Remediations for Brute Force Attacks

To address vulnerabilities exposed by the brute force attack, the following security measures are recommended:

**Enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
2FA requires users to verify their identity with both their password and a one-time passcode (OTP) sent to their phone or email. This added layer of security ensures that even if a malicious actor guesses or cracks the password, they cannot gain access without the OTP.

**Disallow the Use of Default or Previously Used Passwords:**
Preventing the reuse of default or prior passwords adds a layer of security, especially in cases where attackers exploit outdated credentials.

**Implement Regular Password Updates:**
Require users to change their passwords periodically. Frequent updates reduce the window of opportunity for attackers who may have acquired valid credentials to use them before they become obsolete.

**Monitor and Rate-Limit Login Attempts:**
Configure the system to monitor login attempts and temporarily block or lock accounts after a set number of failed login attempts. This measure mitigates brute force attacks by limiting their effectiveness.

By combining these measures, the organization can strengthen its defenses against brute force attacks and reduce the likelihood of a similar incident in the future.
