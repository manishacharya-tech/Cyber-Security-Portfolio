# NIST Cybersecurity Framework Analysis Report for a Multimedia Company 

### Summary
The organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack caused by a flood of ICMP packets targeting the internal network. This event rendered network services unresponsive. The cybersecurity team identified the attack and responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping non-critical network services, and restoring critical systems to resume operations. 

### NIST CSF 
| No | Description |
|:-:|---|
| **1** | **Identify:** <br> The cybersecurity team determined that a malicious actor exploited an unconfigured firewall to launch an ICMP flood attack. This flood overwhelmed the internal network, disrupting all critical network services. An audit of systems, devices, and access policies revealed that the firewall lacked proper configuration, creating a vulnerability that the attacker exploited. | 
| **2** | **Protect:** <br> To mitigate future risks, the team implemented a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets and configured the firewall to verify source IP addresses, reducing the risk of spoofed traffic. Additionally, the organization plans to deploy an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to filter ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics. These measures aim to secure the network and prevent similar attacks. |
| **3** | **Detect:** <br> The team has deployed network monitoring software to continuously detect abnormal traffic patterns and potential threats. In the short term, the organization is utilizing Auvik, which provides traffic analysis and performance monitoring. Over the long term, the team plans to develop a customized Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored to the organizationâ€™s needs. Source IP verification was also configured on the firewall to detect and block spoofed packets. |
| **4** | **Respond:** <br> During the incident, the team blocked incoming ICMP packets and took all non-critical network services offline to stabilize the network. Critical network services were restored promptly. Network logs, captured using **tcpdump**, were analyzed to identify the source and nature of the attack. Moving forward, the organization will isolate affected systems during incidents, restore critical services, and document findings to report to management and, if necessary, legal authorities. The implementation of IDS/IPS and enhanced firewall rules will further strengthen incident response capabilities. |
| **5** | **Recover:** <br> Recovery involved restoring network services to a functional state while ensuring the attack was mitigated. Non-critical network services were stopped to reduce internal traffic, enabling the restoration of critical services first. After the ICMP flood subsided, normal operations were resumed. In future incidents, similar recovery protocols will be followed, with a focus on minimizing downtime and ensuring prompt service restoration. |
| **Reflections/Notes** | The incident highlights the importance of proactive network defense measures, including properly configured firewalls, regular audits, and comprehensive monitoring systems, to mitigate vulnerabilities and enhance organizational resilience against DDoS attacks. |
