# Network Attack Analysis

## Identify the Type of Attack That May Have Caused This Network Interruption 

One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is a **SYN flood attack**, a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The logs indicate that the web server has been flooded with a high volume of SYN packet requests from a single malicious IP address. This overwhelms the server, causing it to stop responding to legitimate connection requests. As a result, the server becomes unavailable, and legitimate users cannot access the website.

## Part 2: Explain How the Attack is Causing the Website Malfunction 
When visitors attempt to access the website, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol to establish a connection. The process consists of the following steps: 

| Step | Description |
|:-:|---|
| **1** | A **SYN packet** is sent from the client (source) to the server (destination) as a request to establish a connection. |
| **2** | The server (destination) responds with a **SYN-ACK packet**, acknowledging the connection request and reserving resources for the client. |
| **3** | Finally, the client (source) completes the handshake by sending an **ACK packet**, confirming the connection. |

* In the case of a **SYN flood attack**, a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets to the server simultaneously. These packets overwhelm the server's resources, which are reserved to handle the connection requests. Since the malicious actor does not complete the handshake, the server is left with exhausted resources, making it unable to process legitimate connection requests. <br>
* The logs reveal that after the SYN flood attack was initiated, the server became overwhelmed and could no longer process incoming SYN requests. This results in legitimate users receiving connection timeout errors as the server fails to establish new connections.
