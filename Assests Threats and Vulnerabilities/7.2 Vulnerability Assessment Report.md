# Vulnerability Assessment Report 

Date : 22nd October 2024

## System Desrcription
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.   

## Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from August 2024 to October 2024. The risk analysis of the information system is based on [NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final). Alternatively, please have a look on other versions published by NIST. 

## Purpose
The database server is a centralized computer system that stores and manages large amounts of data. The server is used to store customer, campaign, and analytic data that can later be analyzed to track performance and personalize marketing efforts. It is critical to secure the system because of its regular use for marketing operations.

## Risk Assessment
| Threat source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Hackers | Sensitive information is leaked to public due to exfiltration | 3 | 3 | 9|
| Former employees | Sensitive information is leaked to public or sold to competitors by the former employees | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Current employees | Disrupt operation activities | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Customer | Alter information | 1 | 3 | 3| 

## Approach 
The identified risks are based on the data storage and management procedures of the business. Three potential threats were considered: competitors, hackers, and malicious software. In the highly competitive e-commerce industry, competitors may seek to exploit unrestricted access to sensitive data, posing a significant risk. Additionally, hackers and malicious software could alter or delete customer data, potentially disrupting mission-critical operations. The likelihood of these threats occurring is heightened by open access permissions within the information system, and the severity of such incidents could severely impact day-to-day operations.

## Remediation Strategy
The implementation of the principle of least privilege will be a primary control to ensure that only employees who require access to specific resources are granted permissions. To mitigate the risk of sensitive information being exfiltrated by competitors, business partners, or suppliers, the use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can be employed for secure data transmission. Additionally, implementing Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) mechanisms will enhance access control to computer resources, enforce policies, audit usage, and provide necessary information for service billing. Furthermore, role-based access controls, strong passwords, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) will limit user privileges, while encryption of data in transit using TLS, instead of SSL, will safeguard data integrity. Finally, IP allow-listing can be used to restrict database access to corporate offices, preventing unauthorized external connections.
