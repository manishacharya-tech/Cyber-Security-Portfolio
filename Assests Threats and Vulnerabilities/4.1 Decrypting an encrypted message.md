# Decrypting an encrypted message

## Scenario

In this scenario, all of the files in your home directory have been encrypted. You’ll need to use Linux commands to break the Caesar cipher and decrypt the files so that you can read the hidden messages they contain.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: **First**, you’ll explore the contents of the home directory and read the contents of a file. **Next**, you’ll find a hidden file and decrypt the Caesar cipher it contains. **Finally**, you’ll decrypt the encrypted data file to recover your data and reveal the hidden message.

**Note:** *The lab starts with you logged in as user analyst, with your home directory, /home/analyst, as the current working directory.*

## Activity 

### Read the contents of a file
In this task, you need to explore the contents of your home directory and read the contents of a file to get further instructions.

* Use the `ls` command to list the files in the directory:
`ls /home/analyst`.

Two files, `Q1.encrypted` and `README.txt`, and a subdirectory, `caesar`, are listed:

The `README.txt` file contains an important message with instructions you need to follow.

* Use the cat command to list the contents of the `README.txt` file.

This will display the following output:

The message in the `README.txt` file advises that the `caesar` subdirectory contains a hidden file.

### Find a hidden file
In this task, you need to find a hidden file in your home directory and decrypt the Caesar cipher it contains.
* First, use the `cd` command to change to the `caesar` subdirectory of your home directory:

* Use the `ls -a` command to list all files, including hidden files, in your home directory.

![Picture4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbcfd96-f92b-410d-acbd-7160a3766362)

This will display the following output:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc7d06c-f929-474e-bd39-19d0e1495ae0)

Hidden files in Linux can be identified by their name starting with a period (.).

* Use the `cat` command to list the contents of the hidden file:
`cat .leftShift3`.

![Picture5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f1e0e8-487c-4baa-b682-e80b69b77f55)

The message in the `.leftShift3` file appears to be scrambled. This is because the data has been encrypted using a Caesar cipher. This cipher can be solved by shifting each alphabet character to the left or right by a fixed number of spaces. In this example, the shift is three letters to the left. Thus "d" stands for "a", and "e" stands for "b".

* Decrypt the Cipher using the command `cat` and `tr`:
`cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"`.

**Note:** *The `tr` command translates text from one set of characters to another, using a mapping. The first parameter to the `tr` command represents the input set of characters, and the second represents the output set of characters. Hence, if you provide parameters “abcd” and “pqrs”, and the input string to the `tr` command is “ac”, the output string will be “pr".*

This will display the following output:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff0f8e7c-0f7d-44ca-9171-2bc557369fc9)

In this case, the command `tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"` translates all the lowercase and uppercase letters in the alphabet back to their original position. The first character set, indicated by `"d-za-cD-ZA-C"`, is translated to the second character set, which is `"a-zA-Z"`.

Now, return to your home directory before completing the next task:

Decrypt a file 
* Returning to the initial working directory we run the following command to decrypt a file:
`openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute`.

![Picture8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a377ad-c62b-4aeb-97e8-f9d26d877dfe)

In this instance, the `openssl` command reverses the encryption of the file with a secure symmetric cipher, as indicated by `AES-256-CBC`. The `-pbkdf2` option is used to add extra security to the key, and `-a` indicates the desired encoding for the output. The `-d` indicates decrypting, while `-in` specifies the input file and `-out` specifies the output file. The `-k` specifies the password, which in this example is `ettubrute.`

* Use the `ls` command to list the contents of your current working directory again.

![Picture9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e28b8af-7f31-4062-b582-e8cc28c5aaf8)

The new file `Q1.recovered` in the directory listing is the decrypted file and contains a message.

* Use the `cat` command to list the contents of the `Q1.recovered file`.

The command to complete this step:
