## Cyber Attack Mindset Report

|Points| Description|

|Contents | The USB stick contains personally identifiable information (PII) related to Jorge, his soon-to-be wife, and family members, as well as employees at the hospital. In addition, it holds sensitive company data, including the employee schedule, new hire information, and budget details. Storing both personal and work-related files on the same device presents a security risk.|
|Attacker mindset | The information on the USB stick could be exploited by an attacker to create a "honeypot" attack, also known as a Ghost attack. By tricking a colleague into opening the files, the attacker could gain unvetted access to the hospitalâ€™s computer systems. If the drive were to fall into the wrong hands, the sensitive data could be used against Jorge, his family, and hospital employees, potentially leading to identity theft, social engineering attacks, or other malicious activities targeting both personal and work-related information.|
|Risk analysis | ETo mitigate these types of attacks, several controls can be implemented. A technical control such as disabling AutoPlay on company computers would prevent automatic execution of malicious code when a USB drive is plugged in. Operationally, routine antivirus scans can help detect and remove any potential threats from USB drives before they affect the system. Additionally, promoting employee awareness and training on the risks associated with unknown USB devices is a managerial control that can help reduce the likelihood of an employee inadvertently introducing malware into the network. These measures together would help protect both company and personal information from being exploited.|
