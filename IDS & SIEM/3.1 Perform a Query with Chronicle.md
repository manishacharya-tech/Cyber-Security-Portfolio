# SIEM - Chronicle

>  SIEM is a security application that collects, analyzes, and monitors log data to track critical activities and detect potential threats within an organization.

>  Chronicle is a cloud-native service built on Googleâ€™s infrastructure, designed for enterprises. It allows organizations to securely store, analyze, and search through large volumes of security and network telemetry data to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.

## Overview 

In Chronicle, the **Search** field allows you to look for specific events across your data. **Procedural Filtering** can be applied to narrow down search results by adding filters that include or exclude particular event types or log sources. For example, it can be used to focus on specific event characteristics or sources of log data.

Additionally, **YARA-L** is a specialized language used to create rules that help search through the ingested log data. These rules can be tailored to identify patterns or specific events of interest, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of searches.

There are two types of searches in Chronicle: **Unified Data Mode (UDM)** and **Raw Log Search**.

**Unified Data Mode (UDM)** is the default search type in Chronicle. It searches through security data that has been ingested, parsed, and normalized. UDM searches are faster because the data is indexed and structured, making it more efficient for retrieving results.

**Raw Log Search** searches through unparsed, raw logs. This search type is slower than UDM because it works with raw data. However, it offers greater flexibility, allowing users to specify details like usernames, filenames, hashes, and more. It also supports regular expressions to refine searches and match specific patterns in the log data.

## Scenario 

You are a security analyst at a financial services company. You receive an alert that an employee received a phishing email in their inbox. You review the alert and identify a suspicious domain name contained in the email's body: `signin.office365x24.com`. You need to determine whether any other employees have received phishing emails containing this domain and whether they have visited the domain. 

## Expectation 
* Review threat intelligence reports related to the domain.
* Identify assets that have accessed the domain.
* Analyze the HTTP events associated with the domain.
* Determine which assets submitted login credentials to the domain.
* Identify other related domains.

## Task 1 Perfom a Domain Search
To begin, complete these steps to perform a domain search for the domain contained in the phishing email. Then, search for events using information like hostnames, domains, IP addresses, URLs, email addresses, usernames, and file hashes. 

1. In the search bar, type **`signin.office365x24.com`** and click **Search**. Under **DOMAINS**, **`signin.office365x24.com`** will be listed. This tells you that the domain exists in the ingested data. 

2. Click **`signin.office365x24.com`** to complete the search.

3. Click **`Go to Legacy View`** to use the original chronicle interface.

## Task 2 Evaluate the Search Results
After performing a domain search, you'll be in the domain view. Evaluate the search results and observe the following:

1. **VT CONTEXT:** This section provides the VirusTotal information available for the domain. 

2. **WHOIS:** This section provides a summary of information about the domain using WHOIS, a free and publicly available directory that includes information about registered domain names, such as the name and contact information of the domain owner. In cybersecurity, this information is helpful in assessing a domain's reputation and determining the origin of malicious websites. 

3. **Prevalence:** This section provides a graph which outlines the historical prevalence of the domain. This can be helpful when you need to determine whether the domain has been accessed previously. Usually, less prevalent domains may indicate a greater threat. 

4. **RESOLVED IPS:** This insight card provides additional context about the domain, such as the IP address that maps to **`signin.office365x24.com`**, which is **`40.100.174.34`**. Clicking on this IP will run a new search for the IP address in Chronicle. Insight cards can be helpful in expanding the domain investigation and further investigating an indicator to determine whether there is a broader compromise.

5. **SIBLING DOMAINS:** This insight card provides additional context about the domain. Sibling domains share a common top or parent domain. For example, here the sibling domain is listed as **`login.office365x24.com`**, which shares the same top domain **`office365x24.com`** with the domain you're investigating: **`signin.office365x24.com`**.

6. Click **TIMELINE**. This tab provides information about the events and interactions made with this domain. Click **EXPAND ALL** to reveal the details about the HTTP requests made including GET and POST requests.  A **`GET`** request retrieves data from a server while a **`POST`** request submits data to a server.

7. Click **ASSETS**. This tab provides a list of the assets that have accessed the domain.

## Task 3 Investigate the Threat Intelligence Data
Now that you've retrieved results for the domain name, the next step is to determine whether the domain is malicious. Chronicle provides quick access to threat intelligence data from the search results that you can use to help your investigation. Follow these steps to analyze the threat intelligence data and use your incident handler's journal to record interesting data:

1. Click on **VT CONTEXT** to analyze the available VirusTotal information about this domain. There is no VirusTotal information about this domain. To exit the VT CONTEXT window, click the **X**.

2. By **Top Private Domain**, click **`office365x24.com`** to access the domain view for **`office365x24.com`**. Click **VT CONTEXT** to assess the VirusTotal information about this domain. In the pop up, you can observe that one vendor has flagged this domain as malicious. Exit the VT CONTEXT window. Click the back button in your browser to go back to the domain view for the **`signin.office365x24.com`** search.

## Task 4 Investigate the Affected Assests and Events
Information about the events and assets relating to the domain are separated into the two tabs: TIMELINE and ASSETS. TIMELINE shows the timeline of events that includes when each asset accessed the domain. ASSETS list hostnames, IP addresses, MAC addresses, or devices that have accessed the domain. 

Investigate the affected assets and events by exploring the tabs:

1. **ASSETS:** There are several different assets that have accessed the domain, along with the date and time of access. Using your incident handler's journal, record the name and number of assets that have accessed the domain. 

2. **TIMELINE:** Click **EXPAND ALL** to reveal the details about the HTTP requests made, including **`GET`** and **`POST`** requests. The **`POST`** information is especially useful because it means that data was sent to the domain. It also suggests a possible successful phish. Using your incident handler's journal, take note of the **`POST`** requests to the **`/login.php`** page. For more details about the connections, open the raw log viewer by clicking the open icon.

## Task 5 Investigate the Resolved IP Address
So far, you have collected information about the domain's reputation using threat intelligence, and you've identified the assets and events associated with the domain. Based on this information, it's clear that this domain is suspicious and most likely malicious. But before you can confirm that it is malicious, there's one last thing to investigate.

Attackers sometimes reuse infrastructure for multiple attacks. In these cases, multiple domain names resolve to the same IP address.

Investigate the IP address found under the **RESOLVED IPS** insight card to identify if the **`signin.office365x24.com`** domain uses another domain. Follow these steps: 

1. Under **`RESOLVED IPS`**, click the IP address 40.100.174.34.

2. Evaluate the search results for this IP address and use your incident handler's journal to take note of the following:

    a. **TIMELINE:** Take note of the additional POST request. A new POST suggests that an asset may have been phished.

    b. **ASSETS:** Take note of the additional affected assets.

    c. **DOMAINS:** Take note of the additional domains associated with this IP address.
