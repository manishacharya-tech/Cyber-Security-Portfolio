# SIEM - Splunk 
> Splunk is a platform that empowers organizations to prevent major issues, detect threats, restore services, and drive transformation by providing the visibility and insights they require.

## Overview 
SIEM, such as an Splunk, is an important part of a security analyst's toolbox because it provides a platform for storing, analyzing, and reporting on data from different sources. The Splunk's querying language, called Search Processing Language (SPL), includes the use of pipes and wildcards. In addition, the effective search helps us efficiently identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within data. 

## Scenario 
You are a security analyst working at the e-commerce store Buttercup Games. You've been tasked with identifying whether there are any possible security issues with the mail server. To do so, you must explore any failed SSH logins for the root account.  

## Task 1: Create a Splunk Cloud Account
To use Splunk Cloud, you must create an account.

## Task 2: Signup for a Free Splunk Cloud Trial
Sign up for a free Splunk Cloud trial.

## Task 3: Upload Data into Splunk
To operate effectively, it's essential that SIEM tools ingest and index data. SIEM tools collect and process data so that it becomes searchable events that can be queried, viewed, and analyzed.

So far, you've created a Splunk account and activated and accessed the Splunk Cloud free trial, but your Splunk Cloud instance does not contain any data. Next, you'll need to upload data into Splunk to start querying. Complete the following steps to upload data into Splunk:

1. Select and upload the file `tutorialdata.zip`. Please visit this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDz_DZB4ADbD4tvaDa54_l1FoT_jtVy4/view) to download the file.
2. Navigate to Splunk Home from your Splunk Cloud free trial instance. You might need to log in again using your credentials from Step 3.
3. On the Splunk bar, click **Settings**. Then click the **Add Data** icon.
4. Click **Upload**.
5. Click the **Select File** button.
6. Upload the **`tutorialdata.zip`** file, and click **Open**.
7. Click the **Next** button to continue to **Input Settings**.
8. By the **Host** section, select **Segment in path** and enter **1** as the segment number.
9. Click the **Review** button and review the details of the upload before you submit. The details should be as follows: 

    * Input Type: Uploaded File
  
    * File Name: tutorialdata.zip
  
    * Source Type: Automatic
  
    * Host: Source path segment number: 1 
  
    * Index: Default
  
11. Click **Submit**. Once Splunk has ingested the data, you will receive confirmation that the file was successfully uploaded.

## Task 4: Perform a Basic Search
Take a moment to examine the Splunk Cloud interface by locating the app panel, the Explore Splunk panel, and the Splunk bar.

Now that you've uploaded the data into Splunk, perform your first query to confirm that the data has been ingested, indexed, and is searchable. Follow these steps to perform a query:

1. Navigate to Splunk Home. (To return to Splunk Home, click the Splunk Cloud logo on the Splunk Cloud page.)
2. Click **Search & Reporting**. You may close any pop ups that appear.
3. In the search bar,  enter your search query:
**`index="main"`**
This search term specifies the index. An **index** is a repository for data. Here, the index is a single dataset containing events from an index named main.
4. Select **All Time** from the time range dropdown to search for all the events across all time.
5. Click the search button. Note that the search button is represented by the magnifying glass icon. Your search should retrieve thousands of events.

## Task 5: Evaluate the Fields
When Splunk indexes data, it attaches fields to each event. These fields become part of the searchable index event data. This helps security analysts easily search for and find the specific data they need. Now that you've run your first query, examine the search results and the fields.

For each event the fields are `host`, `source`, and `sourcetype`. Under **SELECTED FIELDS**, examine the same fields.

![Select Fields](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e45e776-3711-48a7-ac66-3e268a294265)

Examine the field values by clicking on the field under **SELECTED FIELDS**. You should observe the following:

* **host:** The host field specifies the name of the network host from which the event originated. In this search there are five hosts:

  * **`mailsv`** - Buttercup Games' mail server. Examine events generated from this host.

  * **`www1`** - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

  * **`www2`** - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

  * **`www3`** - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

  * **`vendor_sales`** - Information about Buttercup Games' retail sales.

* **source:** The source field indicates the file name from which the event originates. You should identify eight sources. Notice **`/mailsv/secure.log`**, which is a log file that contains information related to authentication and authorization attempts on the mail server.

* **sourcetype:** The sourcetype determines how data is formatted. You should observe three sourcetypes. Examine **`secure-2`**.

## Task 6: Narrow your Search
Because you've been tasked with exploring any failed SSH logins for the root account on the mail server, you'll need to narrow the search results for events from the mail server.

Under **SELECTED FIELDS**, click **host** and click **mailsv**.

Notice that a new term has been added to the search bar: **`index=main host=mailsv`**. The search results have narrowed to over 9000 events that are generated by the mail server.

## Task 7: Search for a Failed Login for Root
Now that you've narrowed your search results to events generated by the mail server, continue to narrow the search to locate any failed SSH logins for the **root** account. 

1. Clear the search bar.

2. Enter **`index=main host=mailsv fail* root`** into the search bar. This search expands on the search from the previous task and searches for the keyword **`fail*`**. The wildcard tells Splunk to expand the search term to find other terms that contain the word *fail* such as *failure*, *failed*, etc. Lastly, the keyword **`root`** searches for any event that contains the term root.

Click **search**.

## Task 8: Evaluate the Search Results

Your search from the previous task should have retrieved search results for over 300 events. Navigate to other pages of the search results to observe the events not listed on the first page of results.

### Expectation
* Upload and process sample log data.
* Perform searches on indexed data.
* Analyze and evaluate search results.
* Identify and differentiate between various data sources.
* Detect failed SSH login attempts for the root account.
