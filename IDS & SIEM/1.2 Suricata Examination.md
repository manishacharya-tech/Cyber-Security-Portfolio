# Configuring Suricata and Using it to Trigger Alerts. 

## Outcomes and Skills Gained After Completing the Suricata Lab
* Hands-on experience in triggering alerts on network traffic using Suricata.
* Proficiency in creating and implementing custom Suricata rules.
* Capability to monitor and analyze traffic captured in packet capture (PCAP) files.
* Expertise in examining output logs, including `fast.log` and `eve.json`.


## Task 1. Examining a Custom Rule in Suricata

The `/home/analyst` directory contains a `custom.rules` file that defines the network traffic rules, which Suricata captures.

In this task, I’ll explore the composition of the Suricata rule defined in the `custom.rules` file. 

1. Using the `cat` command I will display the rule in the `custom.rules` file and the command returns the rule as the output in the shell as shown below:

![cat custom.rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45c08d63-87f9-4bac-8ce0-2df7082c17f7)

***Note:** The `less` command can also be used to read file content one page at a time, making it useful for reading lengthy output.*

This above rule consists of three components: **an action**, **a header**, and **rule options**.

### An Overview of Each Component in More Detail

#### Action

![Alert](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/373a89ce-4980-49c0-b2ed-3e1dc05b8046)

The **action** is the first part of the signature. It determines the action to take if all conditions are met.

Actions differ across network intrusion detection system (NIDS) rule languages, but some common actions are `alert`, `drop`, `pass`, and `reject`.

Using the example above, the file contains a single `alert` as the action. The `alert` keyword instructs to alert on selected network traffic. The IDS will inspect the traffic packets and send out an alert in case it matches.

***Note:** The `drop` action also generates an alert, but it `drops` the traffic. A `drop` action only occurs when Suricata runs in IPS mode.*

The `pass` action allows the traffic to pass through the network interface. The `pass` rule can be used to override other rules. An exception to a `drop` rule can be made with a `pass` rule. For example, the following rule has an identical signature to the previous example, except that it singles out a specific IP address to allow only traffic from that address to pass:

![pass action](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c63e6b-33df-4984-aa2a-67c7f91cda16)

The `reject` action does not allow the traffic to pass. Instead, a `TCP` reset packet will be sent, and Suricata will drop the matching packet. A `TCP` reset packet tells computers to stop sending messages to each other.

***Note:** Rule order refers to the order in which rules are evaluated by Suricata. Rules are loaded in the order in which they are defined in the configuration file. However, Suricata processes rules in a different default order: `pass`, `drop`, `reject`, and `alert`. Rule order affects the final verdict of a packet.*

#### Header

![header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6af68426-16dc-4c11-9b4b-f9e83a7ec3ca)

The next part of the signature is the **header**. The header defines the signature’s network traffic, which includes attributes such as `protocols`, `source` and `destination IP addresses`, `source` and `destination ports`, and `traffic direction`.

The next field after the action keyword is the protocol field. In our example, the protocol is `http`, which determines that the rule applies only to `HTTP` traffic.

The parameters to the protocol `http` field are `$HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any`. The arrow indicates the direction of the traffic coming from the `$HOME_NET` and going to the destination IP address `$EXTERNAL_NET`.

`$HOME_NET` is a Suricata variable defined in `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` that can be use in rule definitions as a placeholder for a local or home network to identify traffic that connects to or from systems within an organization. In this lab `$HOME_NET` is defined as the `172.21.224.0/20` subnet.

The word `any` means that Suricata catches traffic from any port defined in the `$HOME_NET` network.

***Note:** The `$` symbol indicates the start of a variable. Variables are used as placeholders to store values.*

So far, I know that this signature triggers an alert when it detects any http traffic leaving the home network and going to the external network.

#### Rule Options

![Rule options](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a0975b9-76bc-4550-89c7-59ef23d02e4b)

The many available **rule options** allow customization of signatures with additional parameters. Configuring rule options helps narrow down network traffic so I can find exactly what I am looking for. As in the example above, rule options are typically enclosed in a pair of parentheses and separated by semicolons.

#### A Further Examination of the Rule Options

* The `msg`: option provides the alert text. In this case, the alert will print out the text `“GET on wire”`, which specifies why the alert was triggered.
* The `flow:established,to_server` option determines that packets from the client to the server should be matched. (In this instance, a server is defined as the device responding to the initial SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet.)
* The `content:"GET"` option tells Suricata to look for the word `GET` in the content of the `http.method` portion of the packet.
* The `sid:12345` (signature ID) option is a unique numerical value that identifies the rule.
* The `rev:3` option indicates the signature's revision which is used to identify the signature's version. Here, the revision version is 3.

To summarize, this signature triggers an alert whenever Suricata observes the text `GET` as the `HTTP` method in an `HTTP` packet from the home network going to the external network.

## Task 2. Triggering a Custom Rule in Suricata

After becoming familiar with the composition of the custom Suricata rule, I will trigger this rule and examine the alert logs that Suricata generates.

1. Using the `ls -l /var/log/suricata` command, I can list the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder:

![ls -l /var/log/suricata](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03213ec2-6321-431e-8393-f5b7a60fa2ad)

***Note:** Before running Suricata, there are no files in the `/var/log/suricata directory`.*

2. By using the `sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none`, command I can run suricata using the `custom.rules` and `sample.pcap files`:

![sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/265538ff-00b5-4cb6-921b-1177f2c2429e)

The above command starts the Suricata application and processes the `sample.pcap` file using the rules in the `custom.rules` file. It returns an output stating how many packets were processed by Suricata.

***Note:** In this lab, using sudo is required to process packet capture files with Suricata, although it may not be required in a real-world environment.*

### An Overview of the Options in the Command

* The `-r sample.pcap` option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the `sample.pcap` file.
* The `-S custom.rules` option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the `custom.rules` file.
* The `-k none option` instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.

***Note:** `checksums` are a way to detect if a packet has been modified in transit. Because when using network traffic from a sample packet capture file, Suricata won't be needed to check the integrity of the `checksum`.*

Suricata adds a new alert line to the `/var/log/suricata/fast.log` file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met.

3. In order to check if the conditions have been met the command `ls -l /var/log/suricata`, list the files in the /var/log/suricata folder again

![ls -l /var/log/suricata](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c974d1ad-c3ee-4bcd-89da-1965a431fe46)

***Note:** After running Suricata, there are now four files in the `/var/log/suricata` directory, including the `fast.log` and `eve.json` files.*

4. Using the `cat` command to display the fast.log file generated by Suricata:

The output returns alert entries in the log as shown below:

![cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d01ca1-ed60-4036-8e9d-4b9d2ab7bb54)

Each line or entry in the *fast.log* file corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert generating rule. Each alert line includes the message that identifies the rule that triggered the alert, as well as the source, destination, and direction of the traffic.

## Task 3. Examining the eve.json Output

In this task, I will examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the `eve.json` file.

The `eve.json` file is the standard and main Suricata log file and contains a lot more data than the `fast.log` file. This data is stored in a JSON format, which makes it much more useful for analysis and processing by other applications.

1. The command `cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json` displays the entries in the `eve.json` file:

![cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffa66435-b892-43d4-a445-e3438c7604f6)

The output returns the raw content of the file. I noticed that there is a lot of data returned that is not easy to understand in this format.

2. Given the unreadable format using the `jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less`, command displays the entries in an improved format

![jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3fc26c7-2eb0-407a-ab04-d68bc17e28cf)

![jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25c761d9-c3b2-478a-a9e1-4b482f164875)

***Note:** I can use the lowercase *f* and *b* keys to move forward or backward through the output. Also, if I enter a command incorrectly and it fails to return to the command-line prompt, I can press *CTRL+C* to stop the process and force the shell to return to the command-line prompt.*

3. Last but not least pressing **Q** exits the `less` command and to return to the command-line prompt.

***Note:** It's now much easier to read the output now as opposed to with the cat command output:

![Q](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe39b94c-091c-41f0-95dc-d79dfe865234)

### Information Gleaned from `jq` command

* The value of the severity property for the first alert returned by the jq command is 3

The `jq` command can be used to extract specific event data from the eve.json file:

![jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7395e95-4d76-4d0a-837c-ec62ba469672)

***Note:** The `jq` command above extracts the fields specified in the list in the square brackets from the JSON payload. The fields selected are the timestamp (`.timestamp`), the flow id (`.flow_id)`, the alert signature or msg (`.alert.signature`), the protocol (`.proto`), and the destination IP address (`.dest_ip`).*

* The destination IP address listed for the last event in the 'eve.json' file is 142.250.1.139.

* The alert signature for the first alert entry in the 'eve.json' file has "GET on WIRE" as the alert signature.

The following is an example of the output of the command above. The `flow_id` is the long numeric field highlighted in orange in each row returned.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b15f175a-43a4-467a-a050-e4ae830c4cdf)

Using the `jq` command I can also display all event logs related to a specific `flow_id` from the eve.json file. The flow_id value is a `16-digit` number and will vary for each of the log entries:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5245c3e3-0643-4169-9fc4-e574f17fd84c)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26f1cd75-62d3-432c-b51a-0a377666a5a2)

***Note:** A network flow refers to a sequence of packets between a source and destination that share common characteristics such as IP addresses, protocols, and more. In cybersecurity, network traffic flows help analysts understand the behavior of network traffic to identify and analyze threats. Suricata assigns a unique `flow_id` to each network flow. All logs from a network flow share the same `flow_id`. This makes the `flow_id` field a useful field for correlating network traffic that belongs to the same network flows.*

### `jq` Tool
The `jq` tool is a lightweight and flexible command-line utility used for processing, querying, and transforming JSON data. It works similarly to how `sed` and `awk` operate on text, but it is specifically designed for JSON.

#### Key Features of jq:

1. **Parsing JSON:** Reads JSON input and presents it in a structured format.
2. **Filtering:** Extracts specific fields or nested data from JSON objects and arrays.
3. **Transforming Data:** Modifies JSON structure, such as changing key names, values, or restructuring objects.
4. **Scripting Capabilities:** Allows complex transformations using its built-in query language.
5. **Integration:** Easily integrates with other command-line tools for data pipelines.

#### Example Commands
Pretty-print a JSON file: `jq . data.json`

Extract a specific key: `jq '.keyName' data.json`

Filter items in an array: `jq '.arrayName[] | select(.property == "value")' data.json`

`jq` is highly efficient and ideal for anyone working with APIs, configuration files, or other JSON-based data formats.
