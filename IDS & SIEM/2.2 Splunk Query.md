## Guided Process

> SIEM tools collect and process data, transforming it into searchable events that can be queried, analyzed, and visualized effectively.

## Task 1 - Task 3: 
* Create a Splunk Cloud Account
* Signup for a Free Splunk Cloud Trial
* Upload Data into Splunk

## Task 4: Performing a Basic Search

* Now that I've uploaded the data into Splunk, I'll perform a query to confirm that the data has been ingested, indexed, and is searchable. 
* Navigating to the Search & Reporting tab and typing `index="main"` in the search bar to view repository for data.
> Adjusting the time using the time range dropdown or time modifiers to a shorter range returns results faster and uses fewer resources. In this instance I decided to select `All time` to view all the events across all time.

* The above search term specifies the index. An **index** is a repository for data. Here, the index is a single dataset containing events from an index named main.

## Task 5: Evaluating the Fields

Taking a closer look at three common components: `host`, `source`, `sourcetype`.

![Three Components](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d525463f-de2c-4f6e-b571-92f29fb69ef4)

**Host:** Identifies the device or system responsible for generating the event.

![Host](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51051b74-115d-40da-a357-0f60645332d0)

**Source:** Refers to the original location of the event data within the device or system.

![Source](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffd9de02-1e30-4474-8ea2-ad837cb04ea1)

**Sourcetype:** Specifies the format and structure of the event data, guiding Splunk on how to parse and interpret it effectively.

## Task 6: Narrowing the Search
On the mail server, I investigated failed SSH login attempts for the root account. To begin, I entered `index=main host=mailsv` into the search bar, which returned over 9,000 events generated by the mail server.

## Task 7: Searching for a Failed Login for Root
Next, I searched specifically for failed login attempts for the root account. In the search bar, I entered:
`index=main host=mailsv fail* root`
* The above query instructs Splunk to look for events where the term `fail` appears in any variation, such as `failure` or `failed,` by using the wildcard `*`. Additionally, the keyword `root` filters the results to include only events that mention the root account.

## Task 8: Evaluating the Search Result
* The main index contains over 100,000 events spanning `all time`.
* The `host` field identifies the originating system or network device associated with an event. For example, in this scenario, the `vendor_sales` host provides data related to Buttercup Games' retail sales, including the number of products sold.
* As of November 1st, 2024, the mailsv host recorded 346 failed SSH login attempts for the root account on the mail server.

## Outcomes
* Successfully uploaded and processed sample log data in the system.
* Gained proficiency in performing searches on indexed data to retrieve relevant events.
* Acquired skills to analyze and interpret search results effectively.
* Learned to identify and distinguish between various data sources based on their origin and content.
* Detected and investigated failed SSH login attempts for the root account, enhancing event analysis capabilities.
