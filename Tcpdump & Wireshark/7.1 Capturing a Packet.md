# Capturing a Packet with Tcpdump

## Scenario 

In this scenario, you’re a network analyst who needs to use `tcpdump` to capture and analyze live network traffic from a Linux virtual machine.

The lab starts with your user account, called `analyst`, already logged in to a Linux terminal.

Your Linux user's home directory contains a sample packet capture file that you will use at the end of the lab to answer a few questions about the network traffic that it contains.

## Task 1: Identify Network Interfaces

In this task, you must identify the network interfaces that can be used to capture network packet data.

## Task 2: Inspect the Network Traffic of a Network Interface with Tcpdump

In this task, you must use `tcpdump` to filter live network packet traffic on an interface.

### Exploring network packet details 

In this example, you’ll identify some of the properties that `tcpdump` outputs for the packet capture data you’ve just seen.

## Task 3: Capture Network Traffic with Tcpdump

In this task, you will use `tcpdump` to save the captured network data to a packet capture file.

## Task 4: Filter the Captured Packet Data

In this task, use `tcpdump` to filter data from the packet capture file you saved previously.
